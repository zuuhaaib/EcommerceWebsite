[13th November] - Sprint 2 Standup 1 Notes by Helena

1. What did you work on since the last stand up?
   We had gone through the sprint 2 handout individually prior to our meeting and figured out what we are supposed to deliver at the end of the sprint.

   Karim for now is going to complete the issues with add to cart feature
   Ajwad is going to work on SR2

3. When do you think you'll be done?

[13th November] - Sprint 2 Standup 1 Notes by Zuhaib

team capacity: 5
participants: Zuhaib, Karim, Helena, Nargis, Ajwad

1. What did you work on since the last standup?
   Since the last standup, we focused primarily on fixing conflicts between different branches. There were some overlapping changes that caused merge conflicts, and we spent time resolving those to ensure that the code on both branches could be integrated smoothly without any errors.

2. What do you commit to next?
   Going forward, we've agreed as a team on the next set of features we will be focusing on. The tasks have been clearly split among the team members, I have been assigned the search bar feature, Helena will be working on the add review feature, Nargis on categories, Ajwad is going to work on SR2 and trello and Karim is going to fix the add to cart feature.

3. When do you think you'll be done?
   We expect the implementation of the features to be completed by Saturday. This includes writing the necessary code, testing it, and resolving any minor issues that might arise during the process. After that, we'll begin preparing for the demo, which will be ready by Sunday.
   We will try to get the docs done by the next standup.

4. Do you have any blockers?
   As of now, we don’t have any blockers. Everything is progressing smoothly. The conflicts have been resolved.

[16th November] - Sprint 2 Standup 2 Notes by Zuhaib

team capacity: 5
participants: Zuhaib, Karim, Helena, Nargis, Ajwad

1. What did you work on since the last standup?

We've been working on the documentation and updating the Trello board to reflect our progress. I focused on implementing the search bar feature, which is now almost complete. Helena has been working on the add review feature, but we're encountering an issue where we need to add a product_id to the reviews, as each review must be linked to a specific product. Nargis has started on the categories feature but has run into a few errors, which we're troubleshooting.

2. What do you commit to next?

Moving forward, we're focused on getting all the features wrapped up by Saturday, ensuring everything is tested and working. Once the features are finished, we'll submit pull requests for all of them for review.

3. When do you think you'll be done?

The core implementation should be completed by Saturday, with the goal of doing a full demo on Sunday. If any errors arise during the final integration or testing phase, we’ll work on fixing them throughout Sunday, making sure everything is polished and ready for the demo.

4. Do you have any blockers?

Currently, the main blocker is the need to create a product page that will display the reviews correctly. This is necessary to allow users to see the reviews linked to each product. Additionally, we need to ensure that the product_id is properly implemented in the reviews feature so that each review is tied to the correct product.

[13th November] - Sprint 2 Standup 1 Notes by Karim

1. What did you work on since the last stand up?
   We went through the Sprint 1 feedback to review what were our mistakes and came up with some solutions to those problems so that we would not commit the same mistakes in Sprint 2. We also took extra care to look carefully into the Sprint 2 grading rubric to know what things we should be more aware of.

   There are not any big blockers so far apart from minor obstacles.

[16th November] - Sprint 2 Standup 2 Notes by Karim

1. What did you work on since the last stand up?
   I am a little bit worried about merging my add-remove cart feature to the main branch so I will work on a copy of main branch so it will be safer. That will also bring some challenges since the first version of the feature was developed with an independent home window, so everything needs to be adapted to the main branch.
