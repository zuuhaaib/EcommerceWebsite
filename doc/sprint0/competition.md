# Competition

One of our competitors would be Amazon which is a well known and user-friendly platform for ordering a wide range of equipment and items. However, what really makes us different from Amazon (URL provided below), is the product we offer and the use of these products. We focus on offering medical equipment which is not a used idea by Amazon and that is what makes us different. While Amazon’s extensive selection and streamlined shopping experience make it convenient for general purchases, it lacks a focused selection of specialised medical equipment.

**Specific Users and Scenarios**

- Users: Our users require reliable, high-quality medical equipment that meets regulatory standards, which general platforms like Amazon don’t fully cater to.

- Scenarios: Bulk purchasing, negotiating supplier deals, and ensuring that all equipment meets medical compliance are typical scenarios where our platform excels. These requirements are essential for healthcare organisations but are not prioritised by general e-commerce platforms.

Amazon’s and other relevant competitor’s primary focus is on general consumer goods, with a business model designed to handle high-volume, low-specialisation products. The healthcare industry, however, demands a different approach due to stringent regulations, product complexity, and the need for professional support. It would require Amazon to heavily invest in product expertise, regulatory oversight, and tailored services for the healthcare industry to compete effectively in this niche.

By focusing exclusively on medical equipment and the specific needs of healthcare providers, we provide a specialised, trusted alternative that is better suited for this critical industry.
