# Definition of “done”

We would state a feature to be done when we have tested it and it would pass the test cases and worked as expected, built and deployed it and tested it out with postman if needed and also on the user side we have worked with it ourselves as clients would have to see if the feature would fulfil the requirements that we wanted to have for the case of that feature.

Also it is important that the work has been approved by peers and we've got their reviews and feedback on it as well. After these steps, we could call that feature “done”.
