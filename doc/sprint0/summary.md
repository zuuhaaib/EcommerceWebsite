# Summary

Our project aims to create a specialised e-commerce platform for medical professionals, including clinics, hospitals, and private doctors, to simplify the purchase of medical equipment. The platform will cater to the unique needs of small to medium-sized clinics and larger hospitals alike, offering a streamlined, efficient buying process.

## Our target audiences would be:

- **Clinics**: For smaller clinics with budget constraints and limited supplier options, the platform will offer affordable, high-quality equipment, with a focus on easy navigation and purchasing.
- **Hospitals**: For larger hospitals, the platform will feature advanced tools such as bulk order management and custom negotiations, enabling them to purchase equipment at scale and manage complex procurement needs.

## Key Features:

- **Simplified Purchasing**: A user-friendly interface will allow clinics and hospitals to quickly find and purchase the equipment they need, with detailed product information and easy payment options.
- **Supplier Transparency**: Users will have access to supplier ratings and reviews, ensuring trust and quality in their purchases.
- **Customization**: Larger buyers, such as hospitals, can request quotes, negotiate deals by making contact with us through a chat option, and manage bulk purchases directly on the platform.

  #### Our goal is to become a trusted marketplace for healthcare providers, streamlining the procurement of essential medical equipment.
