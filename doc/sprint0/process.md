# Process

**Team Organization and Tools:**
Team roles were assigned based on strengths and availability. We mainly used Discord / Whatsapp group for communication and Trello for task management. Meetings were held on Zoom.

**Decision-Making:**
Decisions were made through team consensus during meetings. When disagreements arose, we quickly discussed options and voted, an individual may make urgent decisions if needed.

**User Story Prioritisation:**
We used a points system to estimate how difficult or time-consuming each task would be. Usually, one round of voting was enough to decide, but for more challenging tasks, we sometimes needed two rounds to reach an agreement.

**Lessons Learned:**
Regular communication, clear task assignment, and streamlined decision-making will be crucial for progress. We aim to improve time management and refine our estimation process in the next phase.
