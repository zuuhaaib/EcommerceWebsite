"[29th October] - Sprint 1 Standup 1

1. What did you work on since the last stand up?
We had gone through the sprint 1 handout individually prior to our meeting and figured out what we are supposed to deliver at the end of the sprint.
each person had taken couple of features in mind so we could discuss about them in the meeting and choose the best out of them.

team capacity: 5
participants: Zuhaib, k, h, N, A

2. What do you commit to next?
We agreed on the features that we are going to implement and we splitted them between all the team members and gave each part to an individual who felt it could be doable for them.
Also each member of the team got assigned with doing a part of the sprint 1 steps mentioned in the handout and we defined a due date for each of the tasks for the end of the day on 31th October so we have enough time
after that to put on the implementation of the features as they would require more time.

3. When do you think you'll be done?
Implementation of the features should be done by Saturday so we have enough time to demo and record it as well and also,
the parts such as RPM, Sprint1.md, and system design document should be done by end of the day of 31st so for our next stand up we have those done and we can
start our implementation for the features and rest of the steps of the handout.
So far our main focus until our next stand up would be completing the RPM,Sprint1,Standups and system design document steps.
tasks has been distributed among all team members so each individual can contribute and get the work done earlier.

4. Do you have any blockers?
So far no blockers in the first standup and everyone should be able to get things done by our next stand up with no issue.

for the frontend each part the person dealing wth backend is going to do

3. When do you think you'll be done?
the feature implementations should be done by Saturday so gives us enough time to record the demo

4. Do you have any blockers?
we were going to have the reward point feature implemented but we realized that depends on the products and the customer [rofiles so we tried to avoid the dependency
and we decided to implement the add/remove to cart instead first so no one is waiting for someone else's implementation to be done and then start,
instead with this change we are all able to work on the features all together at the same time.
