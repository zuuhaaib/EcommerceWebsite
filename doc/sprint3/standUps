[28th November] - Sprint 3 Standup 1 Notes by Karim

1. What did you work on since the last stand up?
We went through the Sprint 3 handout and the grading rubric to see what was required for each member to complete and to what extent. 
We were very eager to review if we fixed our Sprint 1 mistakes on our Sprint 2 but we did not get any marks or feedback by this time so we are sticking to the last format we used.

Since all of the merging was done on a copy of main branch, we still need to merge all of the features into the original main branch.

We came across a big blocker since the main branch code was updated significantly both on the back and frontend. This way, the feature was not possible to merge it straightfoward and it had lots of conflicts needed to be solved.
