[28th November] - Sprint 3 Standup 1 Notes by k

1. What did you work on since the last stand up?
We went through the Sprint 3 handout and the grading rubric to see what was required for each member to complete and to what extent. 
We were very eager to review if we fixed our Sprint 1 mistakes on our Sprint 2 but we did not get any marks or feedback by this time so we are sticking to the last format we used.
