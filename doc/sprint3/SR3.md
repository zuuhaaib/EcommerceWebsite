User Stories
As a small clinic, I want to browse products by category so that I can save time and find items more efficiently.
As a regular customer and a seasoned doctor, I want to filter and sort products by price or set a range of prices, and I also want to sort them alphabetically so that I can quickly find the best options. An option to search for the name would also ease my search process.
As an admin, I want the add-to-cart feature improvements merged into the main branch so that users can experience the updated functionality.

Sprint Retrospective
Practices to Continue:
Regular standups to keep everyone aligned and address blockers.
Peer code review sessions to maintain code quality and improve team collaboration.
New Practices to Try:
Strict time limit: Allocate strict time limits for tasks on the critical path to ensure timely progress.
Frequent Small Commits: Encourage team members to make frequent, small commits to ensure continuous progress and easier tracking of changes..
Practices to Stop:
Avoid depending on a single team member for critical features to mitigate the risk of delays.
