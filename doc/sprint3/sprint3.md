5. User Stories
As a small clinic, I want to browse products by category so that I can save time and find items more efficiently.
As a regular customer and a seasoned doctor, I want to filter and sort products by price or I want to set a range of prices , and I also want to be able to sort them alphabetically so that I can quickly find the best options.An option to search for the name would also ease my search process.
As an admin, I want the add-to-cart feature improvements merged into the main branch so that users can experience the updated functionality.
