2. Unfinished Tasks and New User Stories
-I'm a doctor and how the add product to my cart is working is not looking user-friendly & following a nice and smooth pattern.
-I'm a very busy surgeon and I don't have much time to go around the site and follow different steps so I want it to be more connected and the features have a better connection and same template moving forward!

All the tasks for the sprint 1 were completed .
more work will be done on the frontend side of the add/remove product feature and some changes needs to be done to make the website more user-friendly and improve the connectivity to the features and the site itself.

3. Practices to Continue
The team identified several practices from Sprint 1 that were effective and should be continued in Sprint 2:
Regular Standups: Regular standup meetings kept everyone informed and it facilitated quick issue resolution.
Collaborative Problem Solving: Open discussions on complex tasks allowed team members to brainstorm solutions together, increasing efficiency.


4. New Practices to Try
To improve productivity and workflow, the team suggested the following new practices for Sprint 2:
Finish 48 hours before deadline: This was decided by the team so that we had more time to refine our code and sort any bugs and have time for make any improvements on eachothers tasks.
Code Review Sessions: Setting up regular peer review sessions for completed code to ensure quality and catch issues early.
pull requests: before merging snything to main make sure you make your changes on a different branch and you push your changes on a pull request and you only merge it once it's approved to do so. 
Dedicated Testing Time: Allocating specific time for testing mid-sprint to identify bugs or issues before the end of the sprint.

5. Practices to Stop
The team noted a few practices from Sprint 1 that hindered progress and should be discontinued:
Overloading the Sprint Backlog: Avoid adding too many new features before core functionalities are completed to keep the team focused.


6. Best/Worst Experiences During Sprint 1
Best Experience: Completing the login feature successfully and seeing it work in real time was highly rewarding, as it represented a core functionality for user interaction.
Worst Experience: Encountering delays due merging code which caused quite a bit of frustration for the team especially right before the deadline.
