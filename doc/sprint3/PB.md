1. As a small clinic, I want to browse products by category so that I can save time and find items more efficiently

2. As a regular customer and a seasoned doctor, I want to filter and sort products by price or set a range of prices, and I also want to sort them alphabetically so that I can quickly find the best options. An option to search for the name would also ease my search process.

3. As an admin, I want the add-to-cart feature improvements merged into the main branch so that users can experience the updated functionality so that they have better accessibility to the products they want to buy
